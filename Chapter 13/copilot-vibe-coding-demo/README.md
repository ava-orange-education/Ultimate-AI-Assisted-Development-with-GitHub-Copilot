# Copilot Vibe Demo

This project demonstrates multi-modal and creative AI-assisted coding workflows using GitHub Copilot, including:

- Image-to-Code (Figma to HTML/CSS)
- Voice-to-Code (Speech recognition-driven development)
- Diagram-to-Code (Mermaid logic flows to TypeScript)
- Model-aware prompting and dynamic Copilot mode usage
- Tailwind-based vibe coding in a React/Next.js environment

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Features

- **VoiceInput**: Uses browser SpeechRecognition API.
- **Mermaid Parser**: Converts Mermaid diagrams into logical code blocks.
- **Model Hints**: Helps tailor prompts to specific Copilot models.
- **Prompt Summary API**: Demonstrates summarization for prompt chaining.

## Copilot Best Practices

- Use structured prompts for large models (Claude, GPT-4o).
- Pair Chat mode with Agent for automated refactors.
- Try Copilot Labs for testing and brush-up features (VS Code Insiders only).
