# Prompt: Examples of Copilot lacking full project awareness

## Case 1:
Generated a call to `logError()` without defining or importing it.

## Case 2:
Suggested `formatCurrency()` that was defined in another module Copilot didnâ€™t see.

## Tip:
Use inline comments + explicit imports to improve context.
