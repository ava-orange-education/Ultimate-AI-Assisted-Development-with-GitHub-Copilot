## About the Book
AI-assisted coding is transforming how software is built—faster, smarter, and with fewer errors. GitHub Copilot leads this revolution by turning natural language into functional code, enabling developers to focus on solving problems rather than writing boilerplate.

The Ultimate AI-Assisted Development with GitHub Copilot takes you step-by-step through mastering Copilot, starting with initial setup and basic use across multiple languages like Java, Python, TypeScript, Go, and C++. You’ll explore prompt engineering techniques to craft effective instructions, leverage multi-modal inputs to interact beyond text, and unlock advanced features like Vibe Coding and Agent Mode to create context-aware, intelligent workflows. The book also covers integrating Copilot into testing and debugging processes, automating repetitive tasks, and embedding AI-powered coding into CI/CD pipelines to streamline DevOps practices.

Whether you're building APIs, automating tests, refactoring code, or optimizing release workflows, this book teaches you how to collaborate with AI—not just use it. Don't get left behind—unlock the full potential of GitHub Copilot and future-proof your skills today.
