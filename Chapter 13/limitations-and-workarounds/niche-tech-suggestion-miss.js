// Prompt: Copilot fails to complete niche library usage

// Scenario: Using D3.js for pie chart layout
import * as d3 from 'd3'

// Copilot failed to suggest correct usage of d3.pie()
// User had to refer docs for full config
const data = [10, 20, 30]
const pie = d3.pie()(data)  // Correct, but Copilot missed arc config
